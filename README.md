A simple copy of the original roguelike.

#### How do I test?
In the moment you need a linux environment to build the code, also you will need to have the gcc compiler and install ncurses library, [click here](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-install-ncurses-library-headers-on-debian-ubuntu-centos-fedora/) to read a guide.

After cloning / downloading the project you just have to run `make` in the source directory and enjoy!
After the first make a rogue executable will be mounted in the build directory, so you don't have to build it every time.
